# Pygame-Cloth-Sim
A cloth simulation I did as a fun side project.    
Everything was done from scratch except the dot and line drawing, and the mouse input handling were done using pygame.     
Everything else (Physics simulation, custom data types, camera movement...) was done from scratch.

# Controls
- **Left click** to add an unlocked node.
- **Left click while right clicking** to add a locked node. 
- **Left drag** between to nodes to connect them.
- **Right click** to move the camera.
- **Scroll wheel** to zoom in and out.
- **Middle wheel button** and drag to apply external forces to all the nodes.
- **Mouse side button** to cut the lines between nodes. (The way cutting works will be changed soon, the cutting mechanism right now is just a placeholder).
