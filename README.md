# Pygame-Cloth-Sim
A cloth simulation I did as a fun side project.

# Controls
- **Left click** to add an unlocked node.
- **Left click while right clicking** to add a locked node. 
- **Left drag** between to nodes to connect them.
- **Right click** to move the camera.
- **Scroll wheel** to zoom in and out.
- **Middle wheel button** and drag to apply external forces to all the nodes.
- **Mouse side button** to cut the lines between nodes. (The way cutting works will be changed soon, the cutting mechanism right now is just a placeholder).
